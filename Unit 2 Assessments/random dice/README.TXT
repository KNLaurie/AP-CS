PMR

<+s> a lot of things were tricky in this portfolio but i got a headstart on using arrays to type less and make it easier on the eyes

<-s>At first I had no clue how to loop through but I think I was tired becuase looking at it with a fresh pair of eyes made it look so simple
    It took me some time to match the sums with the arrays
